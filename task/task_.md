# Task 1: CORRUCYSTIC_DENSITY Prediction

This task includes:
- Data loading & preprocessing  
- Handling missing values (median/mode)  
- One-hot encoding of categorical features  
- Feature alignment between train & test  
- Train/Validation split (80/20)  
- Model training with XGBoost Regressor  
- Hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV)  
- Validation RMSE evaluation  
- Submission file generation  

---

## Key Insights
- Median/mode imputation handled missing values effectively  
- Feature name cleaning prevented XGBoost errors  
- Validation split ensured reliable performance check  
- Best hyperparameters chosen using RandomizedSearchCV  
- RMSE was used as the main evaluation metric

## Plots Added
- Distribution of target variable `CORRUCYSTIC_DENSITY`  
- Missing values check before/after imputation
